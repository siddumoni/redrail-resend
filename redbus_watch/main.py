"""
Orchestrates one run of the watcher:
  1. load watches from REDBUS_WATCHES
  2. load last-known state from state.json
  3. for each watch, fetch fresh availability (bus or train)
  4. compare against last-known state to see what's newly available
  5. if anything is newly available, send ONE combined digest email
     showing the FULL current list of available options for that watch,
     with newly-available ones marked "NEW" - not just the delta. This
     avoids spam (no email if nothing changed) while still giving the
     complete current picture whenever something does change.
  6. handle fetch failures with a consecutive-failure threshold alert
  7. save updated state.json

`run_once` takes the fetch/send functions as parameters (dependency
injection) specifically so this core logic can be unit-tested with fake
fetchers - no real RedBus or Resend calls needed to verify the
orchestration, diffing, and email-triggering logic is correct.

`main()` is the thin real-world wiring: real scrapers, real Resend sender,
real env vars, real state.json on disk. That's the only part that can't be
tested from a sandbox without live access.
